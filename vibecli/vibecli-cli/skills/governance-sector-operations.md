# Operating System 01 — Governance, Law, and Public Administration

> **Layer:** National operating system (#1 of 23) · **Personnel model:** human-owned, AI- and robot-augmented
> **Cross-references:** `jobs-to-be-done-framework` (shared concepts, teaming pattern, accountability)

## Mission

Create legitimate rules, enforce rights, resolve disputes, administer public programs, and maintain trust in institutions.

## When to use this skill

Load this skill when a task concerns governance, law, and public administration. It gives an agent the sector map: the outcomes that must be produced, who owns them, what can be automated, and where human accountability is non-negotiable. From here, route to the specific role skills under `governance-*` for execution.

## Core Jobs To Be Done

These are the durable outcomes this operating system must reliably produce, written as trigger → response:

1. When society faces conflicting interests, create lawful rules so people can coordinate without constant violence or bargaining.
2. When citizens need services, determine eligibility and deliver benefits so rights and obligations become operational.
3. When disputes arise, gather facts and apply law so conflicts are settled with legitimacy.
4. When institutions make decisions, preserve records and transparency so power can be reviewed.
5. When new technologies or risks emerge, update statutes, standards, and enforcement priorities.

## The universal lifecycle, applied

Every job in this sector moves through the same seven steps. Use it as a checklist when designing or executing work here:

- **Sense reality** — gather data, observe conditions, inspect sources, listen to people.
- **Interpret reality** — diagnose, forecast, model risk, prioritize.
- **Decide** — choose policy, design, action, allocation, escalation, or tradeoff.
- **Mobilize** — assign labor, budget, materials, rights, permissions, logistics, schedule.
- **Execute** — perform the work in digital or physical space.
- **Verify** — test, audit, measure, inspect, certify, and learn.
- **Govern** — maintain legitimacy, safety, accountability, continuity, and trust.

## Human role families (who owns the work)

- Elected official, legislative aide, policy analyst, chief of staff.
- Public administrator, program manager, benefits specialist, city manager.
- Attorney, paralegal, legal operations manager, contract manager.
- Judge, magistrate, hearing officer, mediator, arbitrator.
- Court clerk, records manager, FOIA officer, administrative law specialist.
- Compliance officer, regulatory affairs manager, ethics officer, inspector general analyst.
- Civic technology product manager, government service designer, public-sector data analyst.

These remain human-owned. AI personnel and robots augment them; they do not replace the accountable owner.

## Labor-market grounding (how these roles are advertised)

The human roles this operating system staffs appear on job boards with concrete, checkable signals. The AI-personnel and robot skills here are designed to *support* these advertised roles, not to replace the accountable human in them.

- **Advertised titles & seniority ladder:** Public track: program/management analyst, benefits/eligibility specialist, city manager — graded GS-5/7/9 (entry) → GS-11/12 (journey) → GS-13/14 (senior) → GS-15/SES (executive); state/local equivalents. Legal track: paralegal → associate → senior/managing attorney → general counsel.
- **Skills, tools & tech employers list:** Case and records management systems, legislative drafting and bill-tracking tools (e.g. LegiScan), FOIA/redaction platforms, eligibility systems, e-filing/court systems, Westlaw/LexisNexis, GIS, Microsoft 365.
- **Qualifications, certifications & licenses:** JD + state bar (attorneys); PMP, Certified Public Manager (CPM); paralegal certificate (NALA/NFPA); many federal roles require a security clearance and pass a civil-service assessment.
- **KPIs / metrics in postings:** Case processing time and backlog, eligibility accuracy and appeal/error rates, FOIA response timeliness, audit findings, constituent satisfaction, service uptime.
- **Where these roles are posted:** USAJOBS (federal), GovernmentJobs and Careers.<state>.gov (state/county/city), LinkedIn, Indeed; legal roles also on bar-association boards.

> Grounding reflects 2026 job-posting conventions across LinkedIn, Indeed, Dice, ZipRecruiter, Glassdoor, USAJOBS, GovernmentJobs, and specialized boards, spot-verified against public listings and O\*NET/BLS. Re-verify specifics — especially pay, certifications, and licenses — against live postings before operational use.

## AI personnel in this operating system (deployable role skills)

Each of the following has a dedicated, extensive skill under `governance-*`. Deploy them under the named human supervisor:

- **Legislative research agent** — compares laws across jurisdictions, drafts bill language, summarizes testimony and amendments. *(supervised by policy analyst / legislative counsel; skill: `governance-legislative-research-agent`)*
- **Benefits adjudication assistant** — checks documents, flags fraud signals, explains eligibility, prepares case files for human decision. *(supervised by benefits officer / program manager; skill: `governance-benefits-adjudication-assistant`)*
- **Legal discovery agent** — reviews evidence, builds timelines, analyzes contracts, precedents, and filings. *(supervised by attorney; skill: `governance-legal-discovery-agent`)*
- **Public comment analyzer** — clusters citizen comments, extracts concerns, and surfaces representative quotes. *(supervised by rulemaking officer; skill: `governance-public-comment-analyzer`)*
- **Records and transparency agent** — indexes documents, redacts sensitive data, and prepares FOIA/records responses. *(supervised by records manager / FOIA officer; skill: `governance-records-and-transparency-agent`)*

## Humanoid robot roles

- Courthouse/public-office concierge, document runner, records-room retrieval assistant.
- Facility security support under human supervision.
- Archive handling assistant for digitization and preservation.

> **How these robots work (assumed architecture):** each is an **LLM-brained embodied agent** — a multimodal LLM brain plans and issues physical **actions as tool calls** (e.g. `grasp`, `navigate_to`, `place`), executed by Vision-Language-Action policies trained on world models, robot gyms, and **RLAIF**. Fleets may share one brain model or mix specialized ones. A verified low-level safety layer can override unsafe actions independently of the brain. Full detail in `jobs-to-be-done-framework` and `humanoid-*`.

## Human accountability boundary (must stay human-led)

Lawmaking, judicial rulings, coercive enforcement, deprivation of rights, benefit-denial appeals, and constitutional interpretation must remain human-accountable.

Treat this boundary as a hard constraint. Agents in this sector may sense, interpret, draft, model, monitor, and coordinate up to this line, then must hand off to an accountable human for the decision itself.

## Division of labor (human / AI / robot)

- **Human owner** — accountable for goals, values, exceptions, relationships, signoff, and everything inside the accountability boundary above.
- **AI personnel** — research, draft, analyze, monitor, simulate, coordinate, document. Strongest on digital signals and repeatable decision support.
- **Robot personnel** — fetch, carry, inspect, clean, assemble, assist, enter hazardous spaces. Strongest on physical work in human-built environments.
- **Control layer** — permissions, audit logs, escalation thresholds, incident reporting, evaluation.
- **Public trust layer** — explainability, appeal, privacy, bias testing, safety certification, labor-impact review.

## Interfaces with other operating systems

This sector regularly depends on and feeds: Public Finance, Public Safety & Justice, Communications & Software, Labor & Workforce. Coordinate handoffs explicitly; most systemic failures happen at the seams between operating systems.

## Strategic missions that draw on this sector

Beyond its own mandate, this operating system is composed by these cross-cutting [strategic missions](../strategic-missions/) (the orthogonal mission axis — a mission pulls roles from several sectors toward one national objective):

- [Public Procurement for Frontier Technology](../strategic-missions/public-procurement-for-frontier-technology/)
- [Digital Infrastructure](../strategic-missions/digital-infrastructure/)

## Sector success metrics (illustrative)

- Coverage / reliability: the share of the population or demand reliably served.
- Quality / safety: defect, incident, and harm rates within tolerance.
- Cost / efficiency: unit cost and resource use trending down without eroding safety.
- Trust / legitimacy: public confidence, complaint resolution, and auditability.
- Resilience: time-to-detect and time-to-recover from shocks.

## Failure modes to watch

- **Monoculture / correlated failure** — shared models or vendors failing in lockstep; require diversity and manual fallback.
- **Cascading dependency** — failures propagating from the systems listed above; map dependencies and design graceful degradation.
- **Deskilling** — losing the human bench that can run the sector manually; retain drills and manual modes.
- **Agent-specific failure** — fabrication, prompt injection, reward hacking, silent drift; keep the control layer independent.
- **Speed mismatch** — automated action outrunning human oversight; install circuit breakers for high-consequence steps.

## Deskilling watch & keep-warm regime

Automating routine cases erodes three things over time: the **human fallback bench** (who runs this when automation fails), **tacit / craft judgment** (lost as the experienced cohort retires), and the **learning ladder** (juniors never get the cases they used to learn on). Job and role simulators are the primary countermeasure.

- **Risk here:** Adjudicators rubber-stamp AI eligibility decisions; judges and analysts lose fact-analysis and legal-reasoning practice.
- **Countermeasures:** Require human reasoning on a sampled share of cases; rotate caseworkers; preserve legal-reasoning training and redress capacity.
- **Role/job simulators (keep-warm):** Case-adjudication and hearing simulators on synthetic case files; drill manual eligibility determination and appeal reasoning.

> **Dual-use simulators:** the world models and simulation built to *train the machines* in this sector double as the **keep-warm simulators** that keep humans current and rebuild the learning ladder. Owned cross-sector by OS 22 (Resilience) and the `simulation-training-*` roles; the verified deterministic fallback in `capability-optimization-*` is its technical complement.

## Adapting to any nation (context modifiers)

The jobs above are universal; how they are staffed is not. Re-read this sector through:

- **Scale** (city-state → federation): whether this role is unified or layered across local/regional/national tiers.
- **State capacity** (fragile → high-capacity): whether the owning institution exists and can be held to account, or the job is met by markets, households, NGOs, or donors.
- **Income level** (low → high): affordability of automation and the balance of subsistence vs. wage work.
- **Formality** (informal → formal): whether the people and assets this role acts on appear in any registry at all.
- **Resource & geography**: which hazards and dependencies dominate (water-scarce, flood-prone, landlocked, trade-dependent).
- **Political system & legitimacy**: where the human-accountability boundary actually binds and who may hold power to account.

## How to operate in this sector

1. Identify which Core JTBD the task serves.
2. Select the role skill(s) under `governance-*` that fit, and confirm the human supervisor.
3. Run the lifecycle: sense → interpret → decide → mobilize → execute → verify → govern.
4. Stop at the accountability boundary and route the decision to the accountable human.
5. Log actions to the control layer and surface anything that trips a failure mode.
